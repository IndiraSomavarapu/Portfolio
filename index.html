            <h5>bio</h5>
            
            <p>I am <span class="bluebold">Indira Somavarapu</span>, a working professional living in Baton Rouge, LA with
                my family. I was born and raised in a village called Edlapalli, Andhra Pradesh, which is a state located in Southern part of India.
                Then,
                I moved to Bangalore after getting married and started as an Accountant, later as a Receptionist, and
                finally
                moved into pursuing my career in Information Technology. While living in India, I worked for Fortune 500 Tech companies
                and eventually moved to the USA in 2006 for better career opportunities.</p>

            <p>After moving to States, I worked in the Northeast region for a couple of years and eventually, moved to
                Louisiana
                in 2010. Since, then I have been working at <span class="bold"><a href="https://www.he-equipment.com/"
                        target="_blank">H&E</a></span>
                as SAP Technical Lead (11 years) in Baton Rouge, LA. I had an amazing journey in my professional
                career which has taught me to believe in hard work, dedication, and commitment. I am hoping BU's
                MSSD program helps in further professional growth and leads to more career opportunities.</p>
