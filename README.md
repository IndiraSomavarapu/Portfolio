CS601 WebDevelopment - Summer2 2021
Name: Indira Somavarapu
Term Project: Personal Portfolio 

Personal Portfolio consists of 5 pages:

1. Index: covers personal,professtional highlights
2. Experience: covers Roles and responsibilites of my current job, skill set, employment history, and Education information is loaded from json stored from my github page.
Used Accordian on Experience page which expand/collapse the content.
3. Education: Education background and my experience with BU is oulined using CSS grid.
4. ContactForm: Allows to validate input fields entered and errors will be written to DOM upon submit. Reset button allows to clear the content the page.
5. Vue features are implemented in artwork.html page alone.
I understand there are some common components(title, logo, side bar, navigation bar,footer) which can be utilised on all pages which makes maintainace easy for long term.


Validations: All html, css files are validated using W3C.
Please note that artwork.html has errors related to vue elements
which i understand can be ignored.

about,experience pages are made reponsive.
Footer shows github,linkedin and facebook links to connect with me.

I was not able to figure out couple of things.
1. Sidebar image transisition doesn't work on ArtWork page as soon as Vue script is added
2. Wanted to load json data upon expanding the Education tab and only for the first time when it's clicked.
